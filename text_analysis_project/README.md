# Java Text Analysis and Cosine Similarity Calculation Project

## Demonstrated Skills
- **Java Collections Framework**: Effective use of generic collections to manage data.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Applying OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in designing the system.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Develops algorithms for TF-IDF calculation and cosine similarity scoring, showcasing data handling and mathematical modeling skills.

## Overview
This Java project is designed to handle text analysis by building a file indexing system and calculating term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) metrics to assess word significance across documents. The project extends to computing cosine similarities between documents, facilitating an understanding of document similarities based on textual content.

## Project Structure

### Histogram and File Indexing
- **Histogram Implementation**: Utilizes a generic histogram collection framework to count occurrences of generic types, which aids in the counting and managing of word occurrences in documents.
- **File Indexer**: An indexing system that processes and stores the contents of files, allowing efficient queries about words and their frequencies across files.

### Cosine Similarity and TF-IDF
- **TF-IDF Calculation**: Implements methods to calculate term frequency and inverse document frequency, providing insights into the most significant words in documents.
- **Cosine Similarity Calculation**: Computes the cosine similarity between documents, which helps in determining how similar two documents are based on their content.

## Features
- **Text Processing**: Analyzes and indexes the content of text files, storing significant words and their frequencies.
- **Significance Assessment**: Ranks words within documents based on their TF-IDF scores to identify the most significant terms.
- **Document Comparison**: Uses cosine similarity to compare the textual content of documents, facilitating the identification of documents with similar content.
