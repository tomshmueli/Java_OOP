# Java Programming Projects Repository

## Overview
This repository contains two separate Java projects demonstrating advanced programming skills, design patterns, and data management techniques. Each project is stored in its own directory within this repository.

### Projects
1. **Starfleet Command System** - Manages a fleet of spacecraft and crew, demonstrating complex object relationships.
2. **Java Text Analysis and Cosine Similarity Calculation** - Analyzes text documents to compute TF-IDF values and cosine similarities, showcasing data processing and analytics skills.

## Demonstrated Java and OOP Skills
- **Advanced Java Concepts**: Utilizes Java Collections Framework, exception handling, generics, and file I/O operations.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Extensive use of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Design Patterns**: Implements various design patterns including Singleton and Factory for managing object creation and configuration.
- **Data Structures**: Efficient use of data structures like maps, lists, and sets to store and manage data.
- **Algorithm Design**: Develops and implements algorithms for sorting, searching, and data analysis.
- **Software Testing**: Applies unit testing to ensure functionality and reliability of software components.

## Usage
Each project directory contains its own `README.md` with specific instructions on how to run and test the projects. Refer to the individual project READMEs for detailed information.

## Conclusion
This repository showcases a breadth of Java programming skills and OOP techniques, making it a valuable resource for understanding how to apply Java to solve diverse and complex problems.
