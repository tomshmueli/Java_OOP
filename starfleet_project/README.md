# Starfleet Command System Project

## Overview
This Java project involves the creation of a Starfleet Command software system designed to manage a fleet of spacecrafts, encompassing a variety of spacecraft types and crew members. This system illustrates advanced Java programming skills, including object-oriented design and implementation, use of interfaces and abstract classes, and application of design patterns.

## Demonstrated Skills

- **Advanced Java Concepts**: Usage of enums, static and final modifiers, and Java Collections Framework.
- **Software Design**: Application of OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Implementation of sorting algorithms and data management through custom methods for reporting and data retrieval.

## Project Structure

### Classes & Interfaces
The project is structured around several classes representing different types of spacecraft and crew members within the Starfleet. Interfaces like `Spaceship` and `CrewMember` are implemented to standardize functionality and enable polymorphic use of different objects.

### Inheritance Hierarchy
The project demonstrates a deep understanding of inheritance and polymorphism. The classes extend and implement a variety of abstract classes and interfaces, showcasing the ability to model complex relationships and behaviors.

### Exception Handling
Proper exception handling is integrated to manage typical software anomalies, ensuring the system's robustness and reliability.

## Features

- **Spacecraft Management**: The system allows for the management of different types of spacecraft, including fighters, bombers, and transport ships, each with specific attributes and behaviors.
- **Crew Management**: It handles different types of crew members, from human officers to robotic Cylons, each with unique characteristics and methods.
- **Maintenance and Utility Calculations**: Functions are provided to calculate total maintenance costs, list all weapons across the fleet, and sort ships by firepower and commission year.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository from the GitHub Classroom link provided.
2. Compile and run the Java files using your preferred IDE or command line setup.
3. Automated tests can be executed to verify the correctness of implementations.

## Conclusion
This project is a comprehensive example of applying advanced Java programming techniques to solve real-world problems in software design and development. It reflects a thorough understanding of object-oriented programming and system design.
